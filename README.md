# Power-BI-Project-Practise-

Zomato, an India-based restaurant aggregation and food delivery platform, operates in multiple countries globally. It offers comprehensive details about various restaurants alongside user reviews. The company seeks to identify hidden patterns and anomalies in its data to accurately evaluate its business performance.
The data is available in several Excel files, each containing details of restaurants operating on a specific continent. Zomato aims to create a consolidated, interactive Power BI report to achieve the following:
1. Obtain data on the total number of restaurants worldwide, segmented by continent, country, and city.
2. View global data with the ability to drill down to granular levels.
3. Identify restaurants with the highest average customer ratings.
4. Discover restaurants with the lowest average costs.
5. Filter and analyze restaurant data based on:
 • Geographical dimensions (continent, country, city).
 • Services offered, such as online ordering or reservation capabilities.
 • Average rating ranges, visually distinguished by color.
6. Identify restaurants offering the most diverse cuisines.
7. Design a multi-page report aligned with Zomato’s theme, ensuring seamless navigation across sections.
8. Ensure accessibility of the report on both web browsers and mobile devices.
Project Objective: Develop a consolidated, interactive Power BI report that enables Zomato to efficiently analyze and assess critical business data.
